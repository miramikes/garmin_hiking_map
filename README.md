OSM hiking Garmin map

This mkgmap style files were created to build map with
as many as possible details useful for hiking and outdoor activities.
This map is finally routable! ;)

This map is tuned to work well with my Garmin 78s

Many thanks to people on Garmin OSM forum for answering all my stupid questions.
