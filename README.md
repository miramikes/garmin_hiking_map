OSM hiking Garmin map

This mkgmap style files were created to build map with
as many as possible details useful for hiking and outdoor activities.
This map is not routeable. Maybe in future.

This map is tuned to work well with my Garmin 78s

Many thanks to people on Garmin OSM forum for answering all my stupid questions.
